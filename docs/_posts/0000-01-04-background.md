* To the best of my knowledge, only one work has been published directly about entity bias in fake news detection, for which they proposed a new model, ENDEF, to try to mitigate entity bias from a cause-effect perspective, improving relative accuracy ~2% on average across a couple different model baselines. 
* Other related work shows bias towards LLM generated fake news that they are easier to be detected
* For which this project is different as it will try to address entity bias from the dataset point-of-view
