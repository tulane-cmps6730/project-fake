The protests began in June 2019 over plans - later put on ice, and finally withdrawn in September - that would have allowed extradition from Hong Kong to mainland China. They then spread to reflect wider demands for democratic reform, and an inquiry into alleged police brutality. Now, China is proposing to introduce a new national security law, which critics believe could be used to crack down on rights and political activists. This is not all happening in a vacuum. There\u001b[39m\u001b[38;5;124m'\u001b[39m\u001b[38;5;124ms a lot of important context - some of it stretching back decades - that helps explain what is going on. It\u001b[39m\u001b[38;5;124m'\u001b[39m\u001b[38;5;124ms important to remember that Hong Kong is significantly different from other Chinese cities. To understand this, you need to look at its history. It was a British colony for more than 150 years - part of it, Hong Kong island, was ceded to the UK after a war in 1842. Later, China also leased the rest of Hong Kong - the New Territories - to the British for 99 years. It became a busy trading port, and its economy took off in the 1950s as it became a manufacturing hub. The territory was also popular with migrants and dissidents fleeing instability, poverty or persecution in mainland China. Then, in the early 1980s, as the deadline for the 99-year-lease approached, Britain and China began talks on the future of Hong Kong - with the communist government in China arguing that all of Hong Kong should be returned to Chinese rule. The two sides signed a treaty in 1984 that would see Hong Kong return to China in 1997, under the principle of \u001b[39m\u001b[38;5;124m'\u001b[39m\u001b[38;5;124mone country, two systems\u001b[39m\u001b[38;5;124m'\u001b[39m\u001b[38;5;124m. This meant that while becoming part of one country with China, Hong Kong would enjoy \u001b[39m\u001b[38;5;124m'\u001b[39m\u001b[38;5;124ma high degree of autonomy, except in foreign and defence affairs\u001b[39m\u001b[38;5;124m'\u001b[39m\u001b[38;5;124m for 50 years. As a result, Hong Kong has its own legal system and borders, and rights including freedom of assembly, free speech and freedom of the press are protected.For example, it is one of the few places in Chinese territory where people can commemorate the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown, where the military opened fire on unarmed protesters in Beijing. Hong Kong still enjoys freedoms not seen in mainland China - but they are widely thought to be on the decline. Rights groups have accused China of meddling in Hong Kong, citing examples such as legal rulings that have disqualified pro-democracy legislators, and the disappearance of five Hong Kong booksellers, and a tycoon - who all eventually re-emerged in custody in China. There are also accusations that press and academic freedoms have been deteriorating. In March, China effectively expelled several US journalists - but also prohibited them from working in Hong Kong. The public broadcaster RTHK has come under pressure from Hong Kong\u001b[39m\u001b[38;5;124m'\u001b[39m\u001b[38;5;124ms government, first for broadcasting an interview with the World Health Organization about Taiwan, and then for targeting police in its satirical news show \u001b[39m\u001b[38;5;124m'\u001b[39m\u001b[38;5;124mHeadliner\u001b[39m\u001b[38;5;124m'\u001b[39m\u001b[38;5;124m. The local examinations body also came under fire for a world history question about relations between Japan and China, with the government demanding the exam question be invalidated. The government said it was a professional, rather than political, decision, but many academics expressed concern. Another sticking point has been democratic reform. Hong Kong\u001b[39m\u001b[38;5;124m'\u001b[39m\u001b[38;5;124ms leader, the chief executive, is currently elected by a 1,200-member election committee - a mostly pro-Beijing body chosen by just 6\u001b[39m\u001b[38;5;132;01m% o\u001b[39;00m\u001b[38;5;124mf eligible voters. Not all the 70 members of the territory\u001b[39m\u001b[38;5;124m'\u001b[39m\u001b[38;5;124ms lawmaking body, the Legislative Council, are directly chosen by Hong Kong\u001b[39m\u001b[38;5;124m'\u001b[39m\u001b[38;5;124ms voters. Most seats not directly elected are occupied by pro-Beijing lawmakers. In June 2019, protesters took to the streets again, demonstrating against plans to allow extraditions to mainland China. This time, clashes between police and activists became increasingly violent. The bill was halted, and later fully withdrawn, but demonstrations continued for months, with demands for full democracy and an independent inquiry into police actions. In April this year, Hong Kong police arrested 15 of the city\u001b[39m\u001b[38;5;124m'\u001b[39m\u001b[38;5;124ms most high-profile pro-democracy activists for taking part in unauthorised assemblies. In May, Hong Kong\u001b[39m\u001b[38;5;124m'\u001b[39m\u001b[38;5;124ms police watchdog said it found no significant wrongdoing on the police\u001b[39m\u001b[38;5;124m'\u001b[39m\u001b[38;5;124ms part during the 2019 protests - in a report that was criticised by many rights groups and external experts. The street protests have mostly died down during the coronavirus pandemic, although some small demonstrations, including singing protesters in shopping malls, have started again as restrictions are gradually eased. Now, China is proposing to introduce a new national security law in Hong Kong, which could be similar to the one withdrawn in 2003. It says the legislation is \u001b[39m\u001b[38;5;124m'\u001b[39m\u001b[38;5;124mhighly necessary\u001b[39m\u001b[38;5;124m'\u001b[39m\u001b[38;5;124m and would \u001b[39m\u001b[38;5;124m'\u001b[39m\u001b[38;5;124msafeguard national security in Hong Kong\u001b[39m\u001b[38;5;124m'\u001b[39m\u001b[38;5;124m. However, the new proposal is also controversial because it is expected to circumvent Hong Kong\u001b[39m\u001b[38;5;124m'\u001b[39m\u001b[38;5;124ms own law-making processes - leading to accusations that Beijing is undermining Hong Kong\u001b[39m\u001b[38;5;124m'\u001b[39m\u001b[38;5;124ms autonomy.\u001b[39m\u001b[38;5;124m\"\u001b[39m\n\u001b[1;32m---> 30\u001b[0m prediction \u001b[38;5;241m=\u001b[39m \u001b[43mmodel_text\u001b[49m\u001b[38;5;241;43m.\u001b[39;49m\u001b[43mpredict\u001b[49m\u001b[43m(\u001b[49m\u001b[43mx\u001b[49m\u001b[38;5;241;43m=\u001b[39;49m\u001b[43mprocess_single_text\u001b[49m\u001b[43m(\u001b[49m\u001b[43mnew_article\u001b[49m\u001b[43m)\u001b[49m\u001b[43m)\u001b[49m\n\u001b[0;32m     33\u001b[0m \u001b[38;5;28;01mfrom\u001b[39;00m \u001b[38;5;21;01mlime\u001b[39;00m\u001b[38;5;21;01m.\u001b[39;00m\u001b[38;5;21;01mlime_text\u001b[39;00m \u001b[38;5;28;01mimport\u001b[39;00m LimeTextExplainer\n\u001b[0;32m     35\u001b[0m \u001b[38;5;66;03m# Initialize the explainer\u001b[39;00m\n",
